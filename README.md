# HW1

## Cody Eckhoff

## Ziqiu Feng
* Made the level design for level 1
* Made the level design for level 2
* Applied the static meshes in the level designs
* Showcased the levels in the youtube video

## How does it work?
  Our game works by first loading the menu level, where you can hit play or quit, hitting play will send you to the first level where then you have to walk past the traps and shoot the targets to advance to the next level, once you hit all of the targets
  you will then be automatically teleported to the second level, which functions the same as the first level but is a different layout

## What was used
  We used all of the lab videos which allowed us to make most of the required assets, we used the corresponding book chapters as well, and then we also used the following items:
